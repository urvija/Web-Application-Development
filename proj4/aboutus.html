	<p>Bertha’s Deluxe Chocolates's intriguing chocolate creations are made with the finest ingredients from around the world, 
sourced by Founder and Chocolatier Sally Bertha. Three days following her graduation from Vanderbilt University, she moved to 
Paris to pursue her dream of studying the culinary arts at Le Cordon Bleu. Using her palate as her guide, she then embarked on 
a world tour that began with an apprenticeship in Spain under the direction of Ferran Adrià and continued east through 
Southeast Asia and Australia. Her fusion of indigenous spices, flowers, roots, herbs and liqueurs with premium chocolate 
creates a sensory experience that nurtures awareness of and appreciation for the world’s diverse cultures.</p>

chocolate lifestyle house in Chicago, another step in expanding her mission of spreading Peace, Love, and Chocolate. </p>
